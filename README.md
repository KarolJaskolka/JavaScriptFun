## Requirements

- Node.js

## Running the project

- npm install
- npm start

## Description

Repository created to keep in one place my code during learning JavaScript. 

My main goal was to use only HTML, CSS, AJAX (to send fake requests) and pure JavaScript to focus on elementary skills.

Every (website) subpage in this respository is like mini project, because I think they are too small to keep them in seperate respositories :

- Bill calculator
- Form validation
- Hangman game
- Quiz
- Shopping list
- Tic Tac Toe game
